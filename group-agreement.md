# Team Agreement

## Team Members

* Hamza Ahmad
* Murad Alkhatib
* Mona Salih
* Khaled Alqrainy

## Cooperation Plan

Considering the key strengths of each team member, we have Murad, who is highly committed as he also excels in critical thinking. He usually pays much attention to the way he delivers what he means or does on time. Talking about Mona, she has very good research skills, and she is also committed to learning what she needs or makes her better. Khaled is just the man to handle the tasks when everyone else is just swamped, he enjoys working under pressure, and he has no problem in helping others when he is able to. Talking about myself, Hamza, I just love to try new things and learn form the others and the things I experience and encounter.

As it seems, utilizing and making use of these strength points has been among the most important aspects in planning our project. We agreed that the best we can do is to take these points into consideration when distributing tasks among us, the team members, to ensure that each one of us feels comfortable and productive as much as we can. 

When it comes to professional competencies, each one of use aims to develop a greater strength in at least one of them. When it comes to Murad, he aims to improve his leadership competency especially networking skills because he does not feel that he is really good in dealing with people, but he also hopes to get even better. Mona aims to constantly improve her skills and knowledge on the topics she learns about to maintain that growth mindset, and she also aims to learn from the rest of us and to share her knowledge with us. Talking about Khaled, just like Mona, he aims to improve his skills in handling ambiguity in order to avoid making the lack of resources and information affect his performance. As Hamza, I aim to be more and more curios about new ideas, because this is what matters to me, failing does not mean anything, but it is important to stay positive and curious about things that might help you and give you new perspectives.

To make sure that everyone in the team is constantly updated and on the same page, we planned to discuss the tasks we are expected to deal with everyday first thing in the morning, and to allow everyone of us to talk freely and ask questions if they need. We also aim to making reviews at the end of each day to check the latest updates or issues that occurred, and in order to help or assist any team member who feels like falling behind.

## Conflict Plan

To resolve conflicts, or even potential ones before they happen, we planned to make sure that everyone is on the same page because this might sometimes lead to a lot of misunderstanding. We also agreed that the best option is to handle such cases among ourselves, and to keep reminding ourselves that all of this affects us a whole and our project's execution.

We agreed that if we notice that someone is taking over the project or if they are not allowing the others to contribute to not only notify them, but also to hold a group meeting as soon as the issue starts to arise because this is a group project by definition.

We also agreed on holding meetings consistently to discuss the general ideas behind new features or new additions, but in case someone is falling behind or if they are having trouble understanding something, we agreed on taking turns in helping them as soon as possible, and depending on the area each one of us sees they are better at.

If a certain team member is not adequately contributing, we agreed on giving them two notices explaining their behavior, and in case the team agrees that this member is not willing to adapt or behave, then we might escalate the issue to the instructor.

We will try to avoid conflicts in the first place, and try to solve them among ourselves, but in case something goes out of hands, then we planned to escalate to the instructor directly via the appropriate communication platform, taking into account that the team leader will be carrying the message to the instructor, but in case the issue is caused by the team leader, then the rest of the team will agree on someone to carry the message, but not everyone at once individually.

## Communication Plan

- The team agreed that all team members must be available from 9:00 AM to 12:00 AM taking into consideration if some team member has something that prevents them from attending at a specific time which will be handled in a group discussion.
- Platforms to be used for communication are: Slack, Discord, Zoom, WhatsApp, and by phone if necessary.
- The team has agreed to have flexible break hours, depending on the overall performance and conditions.
- If we start to feel like we are falling behind, we planned to give extra attention to the parts that are more crucial to the project's integrity and overall function. Also, all of us have no issues in allocating more of our work-free time to work on the things that are incomplete or having issues.
- To ensure that everyone's voice is heard, we planned to hear everyone no matter what, and if we notice that some of us are not giving attention or ignoring the others to guide them and discuss their action. We also planned to allocate an hour at the end of the day to listen to everyone if they have any issues, concerns or ideas and so on.
- To ensure creating a safe environment, we planned to mainly focus on the project. The team leader should also be held responsible if any of the team members violates any of the agreed upon items in a way that is badly affects the team's performance. We will also be conducting thought sessions, and to give attention to important ideas.

## Work Plan

To identify tasks and assign them as well, we planned not to let any of the team members including the team leader handle distributing and assigning tasks on their own, but instead, we saw that it is better if we start each day by revising what we have done the day before, and then we begin by planning and discussing the required tasks for the day based on our progress and any other related discussions. 

The project management tool of choice is Trello.

## Git Process

- Everything concerned with code except management material will live on GitHub.
- We plan to create an organisation or a repository and add all the team members as collaborators, but mostly an organisation.
- We have agreed on adapting the **Gitflow workflow** since it is understood by all the members of the team, and it suits our project's needs.
- We agreed to gather to review pull requests for everyone to learn and benefit, but we left the merging task for the team leader. The frequency of merging will usually depend on the way we distribute tasks, but we planned to combine a number of them that are related to the same task or feature then we merge them. We will communicate that it is time to merge when we check the dashboard on Trello.
