## 1. Email Categorizer

* Summary of idea: A command line program that has access to the user's personal email account, and helps the user read the emails that are most relevant emails based on their preferences and activates. It also allows the user to see or read a summary of others emails that are less important or relevant to him like offers for example. This program also allows the user to mark emails that are not relevant as spam. Or they can unsubscribe form the such type of email.

* What does this program offer:

  1. The user should be read the emails he marked as a priority.
  2. The user can optionally view the emails that are less important but in a summarized way.
  3. The user should be able to select the email by number, and then they should be able to mark those emails as important or less important so that the program shows fewer emails of the less important type.
  4. For the emails that are less important, the user can select to unsubscribe from receiving such type of emails.

* Minimum viable product:

The program helps the user read the emails that are important to him, and the program can adapt and modify its activity in such a way that makes the user tend to mark emails less and less as he uses the program.

## 2. Task Scheduler

* Summary of idea: this program acts as a personal assistant, the user should be able to either add reminders, or to select from a list of tasks that can also be scheduled.

* What does this program offer:

  1. The user should can type some kind of a memo and set the time when the assistant should remind the user about.
  2. The user should be able to select from a number of tasks the assistant offers like opening the browser and opening a list of pages so the work place is ready for them when they come.
  3. The user is expected to receive notifications about upcoming tasks.
  4. If the assistant notices that the user is actually using the device near the time of the task, it will not just open everything and interrupt the user's workflow, but instead, it will show him a notification that some task is about to take place.

* Minimum viable product:

The user will be able to add reminders and then receive notifications on time, they will also be able to select from among a set of tasks the assistant offers, and this will not cause the assistant to ruin the user's workflow, but instead, it will just show a reminder if the user is working on the device.
