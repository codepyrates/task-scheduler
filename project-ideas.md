## 1. Email Categorizer


* Summary of idea: A command line program that has access to the user's personal email account, and helps the user read the emails that are most relevant emails based on their preferences and activates. It also allows the user to see or read a summary of others emails that are less important or relevant to him like offers for example. This program also allows the user to mark emails that are not relevant as spam. Or they can unsubscribe form the such type of email.


* Pain points:

  1. Sometimes users struggle to find important emails among other emails like promotional emails.
  2. Unimportant email takes a lot of space which lead to blocking users activities like sending and receiving email.
  3. User didn't have enough time to categorize emails.
  4. User will have to open and read emails that they are already not interested in to unsubscribe from the provider of the email which will cost them too much time.

* Minimum viable product:

  1. The user should be able to read the emails he marked as a priority.
  2. The user can optionally view the emails that are less important but in a summarized way.
  3. The user should be able to select the email by number, and then they should be able to mark those emails as important or less important so that the program shows fewer    emails of the less important type.
  4. For the emails that are less important, the user can select to unsubscribe from receiving such type of emails.

## 2. Task Scheduler

* Summary of idea: this program acts as a personal assistant, the user should be able to either add reminders, or to select from a list of tasks that can also be scheduled.

* Pain points:
 
  1. with a lot of task organizing our goal become difficult
  2. Some tasks are preferred to be automated
  3. Sometimes the lack of organization can lead to missing  more important tasks at expense of the less important tasks
  4. Sometimes users spend a lot of time on tasks that can be done with one command or click
  5. Sometimes users are drawn between opening many apps at the same time


* Minimum viable product:

  1. The user should type some kind of a memo and set the time when the assistant should remind the user about.
  2. The user should be able to select from a number of tasks the assistant offers like opening the browser and opening a list of pages so the work place is ready for them when     they come.
  3. The user is expected to receive notifications about upcoming tasks.
  4. If the assistant notices that the user is actually using the device near the time of the task, it will not just open everything and interrupt the user's workflow, but instead, it will show him a notification that some task is about to take place.
